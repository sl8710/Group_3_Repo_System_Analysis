Project Description: Our team proposes a Smart Inventory Management System (SIMS) for retail businesses focused on the warehouse-to-customer process. This system will optimize inventory management by predicting demand, automating restocking, and providing real-time analytics to support decision-making. Additionally, the system will meet the requirements of all the stakeholders involved (customers, suppliers, users, etc.).  Key features and requirements include: 

Integration with existing Point of Sale (POS) systems for seamless data exchange. 

Machine Learning algorithms predict demand based on historical sales data and trends. 

Real-time inventory tracking with alerts for low stock and expiring products. 

Automating purchase order creation based on predictive demand and restocking thresholds. 

User-friendly dashboard for data visualization and decision-making support. 

Secure access control and data protection. 

Integration with existing accounting system for management of payments, purchase orders, and invoices. 

With this project proposal, our team aims to create a solution that addresses real-world retail business challenges. By being able to track inventory levels and purchases in real-time, businesses will have accurate data to make decisions about how much to order for each product, when to reorder, and how to store inventory. This system will allow businesses to reduce the cost of storing inventory by minimizing the risk of overstock while also minimizing the risk of stockouts. SIMS will improve inventory management efficiency as well as optimize the business’ supply chain. Most importantly, this system will increase profitability, add value, and boost their bottom line. As we proceed with the project, we will continue to refine our requirements, update our UML diagrams, and collaborate effectively using our GitHub repository.

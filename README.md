Project Description: Our intelligent product expiration date inventory tracking system provides a comprehensive solution for small and medium-sized businesses, such as independent cafes and restaurants, to streamline their inventory control processes, ensure accurate record keeping and minimize the risk of product expiration or waste. By integrating a barcode scanner, an inventory database, and a user-friendly display screen, the system simplifies the recording, tracking, and management of products’ expiration dates.

Functional Requirements:
 
1.	FR1: The system should accept input from a barcode scanner, capture product details and log them into the inventory database.
2.	FR2: The system should store all product-related information in a centralized inventory database.
3.	FR3: The system should update the inventory database in real-time as products are scanned and recorded.
4.	FR4: The system should track product expiration dates and notify users when products are nearing expiration.
5.	FR5: The system should seamlessly integrate with other business systems and software, ensuring efficient data exchange and workflows.

Non-functional Requirements:
 
1.	NFR1: Performance: The system should handle large volumes of data and maintain quick response times.
2.	NFR2: Reliability: The system should operate without failure under specified conditions.
3.	NFR3: Usability: The user interface should be intuitive and easy to navigate, even for users with minimal technical knowledge.
4.	NFR4: Security: The system should ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the data it stores and processes.
5.	NFR5: Scalability: The system should accommodate business growth and increasing inventory volumes without a significant drop in performance.
6.	NFR6: Maintainability: The system should be easy to update and enhance over time.
7.	NFR7: Interoperability: The system should integrate seamlessly with other systems and software used in the business.
8.	NFR8: Availability: The system should be available for use whenever it is needed by the business.
9.	NFR9: Efficiency: The system should effectively utilize resources and streamline processes to minimize wastage and unnecessary work.
10.	NFR11: Portability: The system should be capable of being moved from one environment to another, for instance from a test environment to a live/production environment.
11.	NFR12: Resilience: The system should continue to operate effectively even under adverse conditions, such as network failure or high traffic volume.
12.	NFR13: Flexibility: The system should be capable of adapting to changing business requirements and evolving needs of the users.
13.	NFR14: Robustness: The system should handle errors or unexpected inputs gracefully, providing meaningful error messages and not crashing.

 Our system offers businesses a comprehensive solution for effective inventory control, addressing the challenges associated with managing perishable products. By integrating inventory databases, barcode scanners, and display screens, the system simplifies product logging, provides real-time updates, and offers a user-friendly interface to access product’s expiration date. With its tracking capabilities, the system enables businesses to optimize inventory management, minimize waste, and ensure product quality and freshness. While currently focusing on core inventory control functions, such as product logging and tracking, the system's scope includes providing necessary tools for inventory management and analysis. Future development plans include features like order management, purchasing, and advanced forecasting to further enhance the system's capabilities and accommodate evolving business needs. In the future, as we gain more investment and market shares, we will gradually develop additional features such as order management, purchasing or advanced forecasting.
